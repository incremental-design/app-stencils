* The heading of each list item should issue a command that contains:
	* a goal:							"Repurpose 33% more schleem"
	* an (optional) effort-limit:		"with just 10 lines of code"
	* a course of action:				"by adding the dinglebop to your project"
* The supporting sentences should tell your reader where to find and how to use the code to complete the task.
	e.g. "`yarn add plumbus` to your project. Then `import {dinglebop} from 'plumbus'` and insert it as the first argument to your `grumbo(...)` function.

<!-- link to your reader to your repository's bug page, and let them know if you're open to contributions -->

## Installation:

Add Project Name to your codebase.

<!-- * what you want the reader to do -->

[ ] Show readers how to set up and use your project from within their codebase.

<!-- * why?
   * desired outcome
   * underlying problem
   * action
   * compare action to doing nothing -->

### Snippets:

<!-- ## Extension Settings -->

<!-- Include if your extension adds any VS Code settings through the `contributes.configuration` extension point.

For example:

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `myExtension.enable`: enable/disable this extension
* `myExtension.thing`: set to `blah` to do something -->

[ ] List the methods your project provides. Be sure to show readers what the project will do if they use each method.

### How Project Name works:

[ ] Explain how execution works. What is the entry point for your code? Which files correspond to which functionality? What is the lifecycle of your project? Are there any singletons, side effects or shared state among instances of your project? Take extra care to explain design decisions. After all, you wrote an ENTIRE codebase around your opinions. Make sure that the people using it understand them.

## Roadmap:

[ ] List the releases that you have added to each project, and any future releases you would like to do. If there is a date for future release, put it here. If not, let people know that there is no defined timeframe for future releases.

## Contribute to Project Name:

[ ] Describe the tooling needed to develop your project in 3 sentences or less. Then list each step to set that tooling up.

### Setup:

The code for this extension lives in the [incremental.design/app-stencils](https://github.com/incremental-design/app-stencils) monorepo. To contribute to this extension's code, you need to set up this monorepo. See [`CONTRIBUTE.md`](https://github.com/incremental-design/app-stencils/blob/ajay-dev/CONTRIBUTE.md) to learn how.

### Compile:

### Run:

# Welcome to your VS Code Extension

<!--
## What's in the folder

* This folder contains all of the files necessary for your extension.
* `package.json` - this is the manifest file that defines the location of the snippet file and specifies the language of the snippets.
* `snippets/snippets.json` - the file containing all snippets.

## Get up and running straight away

* Press `F5` to open a new window with your extension loaded.
* Create a new file with a file name suffix matching your language.
* Verify that your snippets are proposed on intellisense.

## Make changes

* You can relaunch the extension from the debug toolbar after making changes to the files listed above.
* You can also reload (`Ctrl+R` or `Cmd+R` on Mac) the VS Code window with your extension to load your changes.

## Install your extension

* To start using your extension with Visual Studio Code copy it into the `<user home>/.vscode/extensions` folder and restart Code.
* To share your extension with the world, read on https://code.visualstudio.com/docs about publishing an extension. -->
