**Vue 3 Clips** provides clips for:

- **Vue 3 Options API**
- **Vue 3 Composition API**
- **Vue 3 Docgen Tags**

If you want to write Vue code in Nova, you've probably already installed the [Vue](nova://extension/?id=com.tommasonegri.Vue&name=Vue) extension. If you haven't, what are you waiting for? It's essential for Vue development! If you have, you've probably noticed that it provides several clips for scaffolding Vue files, but it doesn't provide clips for the _contents_ of a vue file. That's what these clips are for. Add these clips to your editor, and it'll help you organize your vue components, and document your code as you go. Use it alongside the Vue extension for a complete Vue development experience.

If you've been writing Vue [single-file components](https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/single-file-component.html#single-file-components) for a while, you've probably noticed that they get really complicated, really fast. Use these clips to bring some order to the chaos. These clips stub out the options in the options API, and the setup function in the composition API. They even stub out the [vue-styleguidist](https://vue-styleguidist.github.io) docgen comments for your components, props, methods, events and slots. Once I started using these clips in my code, it became much easier for other people to follow. If you use these clips throughout your code, the same will happen for you.

Getting started is really easy:

If you want to stub out all of the options in a vue component, use the `options` clip.

If you want to stub out all of the functions in a setup function, use the `setup()` clip.

After you use either of those clips, just follow the instructions contained within them. Every other clip you need is already contained inside both of them. All you need to do is uncomment the clip you want to expand, and hit tab to complete it!

Here are all of the clips that this extension provides.

| **[onActivated Function](https://v3.vuejs.org/api/composition-api.html#lifecycle-hooks)**       | `onActivated()`       | Stubs out a function that runs code when your kept-alive component is activated.                                                                                                                                                          |
