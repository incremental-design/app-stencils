Make your web app look just like an iOS, MacOS, tvOS, Android, Windows, GTK (linux), or Bootstrap 5 (web) app.

If you design apps for a living, you probably have to prototype for a variety of desktop and mobile platforms - each of which have their own, unique visual language. You don't have time to re-skin the same prototype for each platform. With `@incremental.design/theme`, you don't have to.

List up to 6 ways your reader can use your codebase to respond to this change Each list item should contain a heading, followed by up to two supporting sentences.

* The heading of each list item should issue a command that contains:
  * a goal:							"Repurpose 33% more schleem"
  * an (optional) effort-limit:		"with just 10 lines of code"
  * a course of action:				"by adding the dinglebop to your project"
* The supporting sentences should tell your reader where to find and how to use the code to complete the task.
  e.g. "`yarn add plumbus` to your project. Then `import {dinglebop} from 'plumbus'` and insert it as the first argument to your `grumbo(...)` function.

- **reskin your components automatically, by changing the theme's `platform` string**

- **define your own themes by passing an options object into the `Theme` constructor**
