# App Stencils

[![lerna](https://img.shields.io/badge/maintained%20with-lerna-cc00ff.svg)](https://lerna.js.org/)

This [monorepo](https://lerna.js.org/) contains all of the templates, components, plugins and utilities that incremental.design uses to make websites, web apps, and prototypes. Essentially, this is how [incremental.design](https://incremental.design) makes great stuff fast üèé.

# Installation:

This is a monorepo. That means that it contains several packages, each of which is published to [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/org/incremental.design?tab=packages). To use any of these packages, simply run `npm install @incremental.design/<name of package>` or `yarn add @incremental.design/<name of package>`.

# Usage:

How to use App Stencils in your codebase:

[ ] show a quick, 'getting started' example - preferably something that showcases how to use one of the components in the repo

[ ] summarize the amazing new capabilities the reader will unlock when they use this project. Then describe how they can activate these capabilities.

## Packages:

This repository contains the following types of packages:

| Type of Package                                                                      | Where to find it:                             |
| :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------- |
| Vue 3 [Single File Component](https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/single-file-component.html) | `packages/vue3/component-<name of component>` |
| Vue 3 [Plugin](https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/plugins.html#plugins)                      | `packages/vue3/plugin-<name of plugin>`       |
| Vue 3 Helper Script                                                                  | `packages/vue3/utility-<name of script>`      |

Each package contains its own `README` with instructions that are specific to it.

The packages that are currently in this repository are:

| Package                                                                               | Type                        | Location                       |
| :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :-------------------------- | :----------------------------- |
| [`@incremental.design/vue3-component-base`](./packages/vue3/component-base/README.md) | Vue 3 Single File Component | `packages/vue3/component-base` |

## How App Stencils works:

App stencils is a monorepo that is managed by [Lerna](https://lerna.js.org/). Unlike most repositories, this repository contains the source code for not one, but several packages. In fact, the packages in this repository import each other. For example, every Vue 3 Single File Component package in this repository imports the `@incremental.design/vue3-component-base` package. Lerna is the tool that takes care of building each package and making it available to import into other packages.

This repository cannot be "run" in the typical sense of the word. It doesn't contain an executable, such as a web server or an app. Instead, it contains pieces of code - libraries - that can be imported into other apps.

## Develop:

Lerna _mostly_ automates the chores of developing in a monorepo. But it does replace some of the more familiar commands you might be used to:

| Task                                                                                                                 | Lerna Command               | NPM Command                        | Yarn Command               |
| :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- | :--------------------------------- | :------------------------- |
| Build Package with Webpack                                                                                           | `lerna run build`           | `npm run build`                    | `yarn build`               |
| Install the packages listed in `package.json`                                                                        | `lerna bootstrap`           | `npm install`                      | `yarn install`             |
| Delete `node_modules`                                                                                                | `lerna clean`               | `rm -rf ./node_modules`            | `rm -rf ./node_modules`    |
| Add a [dependency](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/configuring-npm/package-json#dependencies) to `package.json`        | `lerna add <package>`       | `npm install <package>`            | `yarn add <package>`       |
| Add a [dev dependency](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/configuring-npm/package-json#devdependencies) to `package.json` | `lerna add --dev <package>` | `npm install --save-dev <package>` | `yarn add --dev <package>` |
| Run the source code in a [Development Server](https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/cli-service.html#vue-cli-service-serve)    | `lerna run serve`           | `npm run serve`                    | `yarn serve`               |
| Run unit tests                                                                                                       | `lerna run test:unit`       | `npm run test:unit`                | `yarn test:unit`           |

The reason that Lerna provides its own commands is because it actually runs the corresponding yarn or NPM command in _every_ package in the repository. Without Lerna, you would have to go to each directory and manually run said command. In a monorepo with dozens of packages, this saves a lot of time!

### Commit

This repository uses [commitlint](https://commitlint.js.org/#/reference-configuration?id=prompt). It will not let you commit your changes unless your commit message contains the following:

1. a **type**. A type is an indicator of what kinds of changes a commit contains. The types of commits are:

   | Type                      | When to use it:                                |
   | :------------------------ | :--------------------------------------------- |
   | `chore`                   | Whenever you make a change to the tooling      |
   | `docs`                    | Whenever you make a change to the README       |
   | `feat(<name-of-feature>)` | Whenever you add code for a new feature        |
   | `fix`                     | Whenever you fix a bug                         |
   | `perf`                    | Whenever you make something faster             |
   | `refactor`                | Whenever you change how your code is organized |
   | `test`                    | Whenever you write a unit test                 |

2. a **subject**. A subject is a one-sentence description of the changes to a commit.

3. a **body**. A body is a list of the changes you made, split up by files changed and commands run. Think of it like a 'table of contents' for your commit.
   - You MUST begin your commit body with a blank line, or commitlint will complain.

Here is an example commit:

```
feat: Add the widget to the doohicky
```

```

1. added the dinglebopper to the blamf.
2. cut the fleeb.
3. Chumble the hizzards.
4. Make the plumbus.

```

‚ö†Ô∏è If you are using a git client, such as [Tower](https://www.git-tower.com/mac?gclid=CjwKCAjwt8uGBhBAEiwAayu_9alH0wnniAyMva6TGRRNLtSv2kftMmfa6egH1qzrEa7xFAnCXco24RoCoWYQAvD_BwE), it won't have access to your `$PATH`. When it tries to run the git hooks, it will fail, because some of the commands require access to `$PATH`. You can provide access to your `$PATH` as follows:

- [Add `$PATH to Tower`](https://www.git-tower.com/help/guides/integration/environment/mac)

‚ö†Ô∏è If Lerna is installed in your home directory, your git client probably won't be able to find it, and will error when you try to commit.

1.  To find out if Lerna is installed in your home directory, run `which lerna`. If the terminal responds with `~/.npm-global/bin/lerna`, then Lerna is installed in your home directory. If it responds `/usr/local/bin/lerna` then it isn't.

2.  To fix this, uninstall Lerna with `npm uninstall -g lerna`. Pay attention to the `-g` flag. It tells NPM to delete Lerna from `~/.npm-global/bin/`

3.  Next, install Lerna with `brew install lerna`. Brew will take care of installing Lerna in `/usr/local/bin`.

### Add Dependencies

To install a package as dependency of any other package in this repository, use `lerna add <package name>`. To install a dev dependency, use `lerna add --dev <package name>`. Lerna will add the package to the [`dependencies`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/configuring-npm/package-json#dependencies) or [`devDependencies`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/configuring-npm/package-json#devdependencies) of _every_ `package.json` file in `packages/`.

What if you want one of the packages in `packages/` to be a dependency of another? Lerna takes care of this for you. When you `lerna add ...` the package, it will build it and then symlink it into the node*modules of the package that depends on it. It does all of this \_without* actually publishing your package to npmjs.org.

### Build

To build every package at once, `lerna run build`.

This will populate each package's `dist` folder with the latest build. In fact, whenever you commit to this repository, the `pre-commit` hook actually runs this command and commits the build alongside your changes to the source code!

`lerna run build` inspects every `package.json` file inside the `packages` folder. It checks to see if the [`scripts`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/using-npm/scripts) section of the `package.json` contains a `build` script. If it does, it installs all of the dependencies in the package, and then runs the script.

Most build scripts run Webpack. Each package's `README.md` contains more details on how Webpack works, and what you can do to configure it.

### Run

To run every package at once `lerna run serve`.

Most packages can't actually be run, so this command only runs the few packages that can.

`lerna run serve` inspects every `package.json` file inside the `packages` folder. It checks to see if the [`scripts`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/using-npm/scripts) section of the `package.json` contains a `serve` script. If it does, it installs all of the dependencies in the package, and then runs the script.

[ ] add instructions for accessing served content. maybe a screen recording?

[ ] how to handle multiple TTYs interleaving standard out?

### Test

To test every package at once, `lerna run test:unit`.

This starts an instance of the Jest unit test framework for each package that contains unit tests. So, if your computer's fans start to sound like a jet engine at idle üõ© ... this is why.

[ ] add instructions on how to write tests, and where to put them

[ ] maybe just run one instance of jest??

### Document

[ ] explain tsdoc

[ ] explain how to install tsdoc helpers

This repository uses [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org) to generate **live** documentation for each component and plugin that is exported. Live documentation is documentation that actually runs the code it is describing. Storybook runs each component and displays the result in the browser. To launch the storybook `lerna run storybook:serve`.

![`lerna run storybook:serve`](.readme/storybook-serve.gif)

For more details on how to add a component to a storybook, consult the README of any `storybook` folder inside `packages`.

[ ] show a screen recording of launching the storybook.

## Publish

This project uses **semantic versioning.** That means that this project is structured into **releases.** A release is a version of the project that adds new features, changes existing features or replaces old features. There are three types of releases:

- Major
- Minor
- Patch

Each major release replaces one or more old features.

Each minor release adds one new feature.

Each patch improves one new feature.

To publish new versions of every package in this repository:

1. Navigate to the root of this repository.
2. Run `lerna publish`. Lerna will ask you if you are publishing a patch, minor release or major release.

- üßê Lerna runs this repository in [locked mode](https://github.com/lerna/lerna#fixedlocked-mode-default). That means that every package in this repository has the same version as the repository itself. Publishing any change to any package will increment the version for EVERY other package.

- ‚ö†Ô∏è Once you publish a package to `npm`, it's _really_ hard to unpublish it. Do not publish unless you are absolutely sure you want to do so.
