# Vue Stencils

[![lerna](https://img.shields.io/badge/maintained%20with-lerna-cc00ff.svg)](https://lerna.js.org/)

This project contains all of the tasks I need to do to make tooling for web development with Vue.js. Think of it like a [parts bin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=204&v=4E793WS72aU&feature=youtu.be) for the pieces of code I use to make sites work.

The goals of this project are to:

- Make a set of reusable pieces of code
- Improve the performance and reliability of the code over time
- reduce the amount of time fixing issues with websites that use the code

# Versioning

This project uses **semantic versioning.** That means that this project is structured into **releases.** A release is a version of the project that adds new features, changes existing features or replaces old features. There are three types of releases:

- Major
- Minor
- Patch

Each major release replaces one or more old features.

Each minor release adds one new feature.

Each patch improves one new feature.

# Developing

1. Navigate to the root of this repository.
2. Run `lerna bootstrap`. This will install all of the new dependencies.

- ü§î `lerna bootstrap` replaces `yarn install`.
- üõë Do NOT run `yarn install` in any of these repositories.

2. Run `lerna run compile` to compile all of the typescript code in each package.

# Publishing

1. Navigate to the root of this repository.
2. Run `lerna publish`. Lerna will ask you if you are publishing a patch, minor release or major release.

- ‚ö†Ô∏è Once you publish a package to `npm`, it's _really_ hard to unpublish it. Do not publish unless you are absolutely sure you want to do so.
